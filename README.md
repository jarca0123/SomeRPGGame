# SomeRPGGame
I wanted to share some code I wrote because it serves me no purpose. But I have a strong feeling that this code belongs to me, so I licensed it with GNU GPLv3. This amalgamation of code is using no libraries, so it runs on Swing. It also doesn't run out of the box, because it requires some PNG files (see Game.java), and it took me about 2-4 months to code this.
